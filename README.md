# EZ180
Easily convert flat photos and videos into stunning 180 experiences!

(**Note:** Compatibility is limited on Firefox. And by limited I mean it doesn't work.)

Has zero dependencies, zero server communication, and no excess code or unnecessary boilerplate (as far as I can tell).

Please, feel free to look through the code and try to use it and learn from it.

Shoutout to Xamayon, creator of [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com), whose image input code was used for this project at the beginning. Not much of the code remains anymore, but the ideas are still present and I wouldn't have been able to get started on this project without it.
